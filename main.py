Once upon a time, there was a {adjective1} {noun1} who loved to {verb1} all day.

One day, {noun2} walked into the room and caught {noun1} in the act.

{noun2}: "What are you doing?"
{noun1}: "I'm just {verb1}, what's the big deal?" 
{noun2}: "Well, it's not every day that we see a {noun1} {verb1} in the middle of the day"
{noun1}: "I guess you are right! Maybe I should take a break."
{noun2}: "That's probably a good idea. Why don't we go {verb2} instead?"
{noun1}: "Sure, that sounds like fun!"

And so, {noun2} and the {noun1} went off to {verb2} and had a great time.
The End.
